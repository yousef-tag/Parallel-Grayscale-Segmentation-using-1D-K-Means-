# Parallel Grayscale Segmentation using 1D K- Means
Segmentation is the process of visualizing and separating different objects in an image 
depending on some data attributes (pixel intensities (most popular), depth, or any other 
data attributes that may be accompanied with each pixel or with a set of neighbouring 
pixels). Weâ€™ll do it using pixel intensities on grayscale images.
